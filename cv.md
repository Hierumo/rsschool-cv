## About Me
> Versatile well-organized frontend-trainee with 8+ month of experience designing, developing some kind of best code ever (among trainees of course). My main goal is to get as much new knowledge as possible, cuz I wanna become the best (or at least a good one) frontend-engineer.
## Skills
* Programming languages and technologies: ECMAScript-7, HTML5, CSS3/Less, Delphi 7, Pascal, Basic, a lil' bit Lua
* Frameworks: a lil' bit experience of using React, jQuery, Redux
* Tools: VS Code, Chrome Dev Tools, GIT Terminal
* Other skills: driving experience 8 years, masterly command of Russian obscene language so I'm so *sociable*, and dunno, Night Elf Hunter 60 at WoW Classic is it worth?
